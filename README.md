Question 1 A chimney is designed to vent gases over the top of an industrial building.   For the design purposes   chimney   can   be   considered   as   a   uniform   hollow   circular   tube   with   a   mean   diameter   D,   a   wall   thickness t   and the   height   H.   The   design   requirements   are that the   chimney   must   not   fail   under   the wind loads, and that the amount of material it is made of is the lowest possible.   For the design   purposes the chimney can be considered as a cantilever beam that is subjected to a uniform. lateral   wind load q   (N/mm), as shown in Figure 1. The following requirements are to   be   satisﬁed:
1.   the chimney must not fail   in either   bending   or   shear,
2.   the deflection at the top   should   not   exceed   127   mm.
3.   the ratio of the mean diameter to the wall thickness must not   exceed   60.
All relevant information and equations are   given   in the   Table   of   ﬁgure 2. According to   the   design   requirements the ranges of values are D and t are:   150   ≤   D   ≤   650   mm   and   2   ≤   t   ≤   15   mm.

Question 2 In   the   design   of   a   structural   component   the   criteria   F1       and   F2       are   to   be   minimised;   where   F1   describes   the   maximum   stress   in   MPa   and   F2      describes   the   cost   of the   component   in   pounds   £   .   These criteria depend on one design variable x   in   the   following   way:F1   (x) = 200(x2   -   4x +   5)F2   (x) = 25(48   -   9x) 
The design variable x   can take any values in the   range   between   0   and   4.
a) Plot the Pareto optimum set by identifying several points in the space of   the two criteria F1    and   F2   . [10 marks] 
b) Assuming that the desirable value of the criterion F1    is 250 MPa and that of the criterion F2      is   £500, formulate and solve the corresponding minmax problem.   Identify the   obtained   design   as   a point of the Pareto 代 写DEN401/DENM004 Computational EngineeringPython

c) Describe   briefly   how   this   minmax   problem   can   be   re-formulated   using   the   bounded   objective   function   formulation.    State   (i)   the   beneﬁts   and   (ii)   any   setbacks   this   formulation   brings   as   compared to the original formulation of the multiobjective problem. [8 marks] Consider   the   two-beam   problem   shown   in Figure 3. The   beams are   of   length L   = 1m and L   = 0.25m,   have moment of   inertia I=2   ×   10-4    m4    and modulus of   elasticity E=200   GPa.   Some force is applied   to the left side of the beam causing a vertical   displacement   of   0.001   m.Figure 3:   Beam bending problem domain.
d) Using two elements to resolve the two-beam   sections,   solve   the   displacement   problem   and   ﬁnd   the rotations and displacements at   the   three   points   of the   two   beams.   You   may   use   any   node   and element numbering as   you   wish. [17 marks] 
e) What force was used to cause the displacement on   the   left   side? [8 marks]
Question 3 The   plane   stress   structure,   of thickness t   =   0.01   m,   shown   in   Figure 4 is   represented   by   a   single   triangular element.   The node numbers of the elements are shown in   red,   their   positions   are   stated   in metres.Figure 4:   Diagram of 2D Plane Stress Structure
a) Using   the   interpolating   properties   of the   FEM   basis   functions,   write   an   expression   for   the   3
linear basis functions at the nodes   of the element. [12 marks] 
b) Form. the force vector of the element’s stifness equations for the surface pressure applied   to the   bottom   edge.   Do this by evaluating the   integral   along   element’s   surface   using   an   appropriate   numerical integration rule. [18 marks] 
c) Use   your   solution   to   part   b)   to   solve   for   the   displacements   using   the   following   global   matrix   system.   If you have not answered b), use the vector provided in equation 2. 

The force vector - ONLY TO BE USED IF YOU HAVE NO ANSWER FOR PART b).   Note   this has no relation to the answers   to   part   b).
[10 marks] 
d) An   additional   body   force   of B   kN/m3 in the   y direction   is   placed   evenly   across the   element.   Determine the maximum value of B such that the displacement does not exceed 0.0001m in the   negative y   direction. [10 marks]
